This is very challenging for audit profession in Laos since obtaining audit evidence online is brand new to the country, so gaining comfort on such procedure seems to be quite doubtful for the clients whether if they have trust in the procedure or have the ability to provide evidence using the online platform. Thus, annual field audit might be postponed if the pandemic last longer than 3-6 months. Moreover, the submission of financial statements of 2019 which is when Laos started to lockdown the whole nation is not an as simple as it used to because tax office in Laos has yet provided online platform for the financial statements’ submission and This causes delays in the submission.  Decreasing in revenue is the most impacted factor in accounting profession. Some hasn’t been able to collect payment from their clients due to many factors such as: limitation of the transportation, difficulty in issuing cheque due to the absence of one’s manager who had to return to their home country, difficulty in expanding one’s client base because even accomplishing normal tasks in timely manner has been extremely challenging and etc. These also result in many companies reducing their accountant pay check down by 50%. While the income has been decreased, the daily expense tends to stay the same or even increased as some companies need to supply surgical mask, hand sanitizer to their employees per the instruction of concern party and a huge increase in utility expense, and obligation to pay tax to the government; despite the lack of income, making a difficult situation for many individuals and entities. COVID-19 has been impacting accounting profession in Laos significantly so far.    Working from home seems to be very challenging for those who are parents because all schools; especially pre-schools, has been closed down. Distraction from ones’ kids and some are not use to online working platform resulting in more time consuming to start the work and communicate with coworkers and customers.   What’s more, although working online can get most of payment requisitions online, sometimes it's difficult to verified for accuracy without seeing original hard copy, particularly for big value payments and online working also limits the process of getting documents signed since it has not yet allowed legally and it's also difficult to verified for accuracy without seeing original hard copy, particularly for big value payments.

/**
 * A transition component inspired by the excellent
 * [ng-animate](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAnimate) library, you should
 * use it if you're using CSS transitions or animations. It's built upon the
 * [`Transition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/transition)
 * component, so it inherits all of its props.
 *
 * `CSSTransition` applies a pair of class names during the `appear`, `enter`,
 * and `exit` states of the transition. The first class is applied and then a
 * second `*-active` class in order to activate the CSS transition. After the
 * transition, matching `*-done` class names are applied to persist the
 * transition state.
 *
 * ```jsx
 * function App() {
 *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);
 *   return (
 *     <div>
 *       <CSSTransition in={inProp} timeout={200} classNames="my-node">
 *         <div>
 *           {"I'll receive my-node-* classes"}
 *         </div>
 *       </CSSTransition>
 *       <button type="button" onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>
 *         Click to Enter
 *       </button>
 *     </div>
 *   );
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When the `in` prop is set to `true`, the child component will first receive
 * the class `example-enter`, then the `example-enter-active` will be added in
 * the next tick. `CSSTransition` [forces a
 * reflow](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/blob/5007303e729a74be66a21c3e2205e4916821524b/src/CSSTransition.js#L208-L215)
 * between before adding the `example-enter-active`. This is an important trick
 * because it allows us to transition between `example-enter` and
 * `example-enter-active` even though they were added immediately one after
 * another. Most notably, this is what makes it possible for us to animate
 * _appearance_.
 *
 * ```css
 * .my-node-enter {
 *   opacity: 0;
 * }
 * .my-node-enter-active {
 *   opacity: 1;
 *   transition: opacity 200ms;
 * }
 * .my-node-exit {
 *   opacity: 1;
 * }
 * .my-node-exit-active {
 *   opacity: 0;
 *   transition: opacity 200ms;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * `*-active` classes represent which styles you want to animate **to**, so it's
 * important to add `transition` declaration only to them, otherwise transitions
 * might not behave as intended! This might not be obvious when the transitions
 * are symmetrical, i.e. when `*-enter-active` is the same as `*-exit`, like in
 * the example above (minus `transition`), but it becomes apparent in more
 * complex transitions.
 *
 * **Note**: If you're using the
 * [`appear`](http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/transition#Transition-prop-appear)
 * prop, make sure to define styles for `.appear-*` classes as well.

   * The animation classNames applied to the component as it appears, enters,
   * exits or has finished the transition. A single name can be provided, which
   * will be suffixed for each stage, e.g. `classNames="fade"` applies:
   *
   * - `fade-appear`, `fade-appear-active`, `fade-appear-done`
   * - `fade-enter`, `fade-enter-active`, `fade-enter-done`
   * - `fade-exit`, `fade-exit-active`, `fade-exit-done`
   *
   * A few details to note about how these classes are applied:
   *
   * 1. They are _joined_ with the ones that are already defined on the child
   *    component, so if you want to add some base styles, you can use
   *    `className` without worrying that it will be overridden.
   *
   * 2. If the transition component mounts with `in={false}`, no classes are
   *    applied yet. You might be expecting `*-exit-done`, but if you think
   *    about it, a component cannot finish exiting if it hasn't entered yet.
   *
   * 2. `fade-appear-done` and `fade-enter-done` will _both_ be applied. This
   *    allows you to define different behavior for when appearing is done and
   *    when regular entering is done, using selectors like
   *    `.fade-enter-done:not(.fade-appear-done)`. For example, you could apply
   *    an epic entrance animation when element first appears in the DOM using
   *    [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/). Otherwise you can
   *    simply use `fade-enter-done` for defining both cases.
   *
   * Each individual classNames can also be specified independently like:
   *
   * ```js
   * classNames={{
   *  appear: 'my-appear',
   *  appearActive: 'my-active-appear',
   *  appearDone: 'my-done-appear',
   *  enter: 'my-enter',
   *  enterActive: 'my-active-enter',
   *  enterDone: 'my-done-enter',
   *  exit: 'my-exit',
   *  exitActive: 'my-active-exit',
   *  exitDone: 'my-done-exit',
   * }}
   * ```
   *
   * If you want to set these classes using CSS Modules:
   *
   * ```js
   * import styles from './styles.css';
   * ```
   *
   * you might want to use camelCase in your CSS file, that way could simply
   * spread them instead of listing them one by one:
   *
   * ```js
   * classNames={{ ...styles }}
   * ```
   *
   * @type {string | {
   *  appear?: string,
   *  appearActive?: string,
   *  appearDone?: string,
   *  enter?: string,
   *  enterActive?: string,
   *  enterDone?: string,
   *  exit?: string,
   *  exitActive?: string,
   *  exitDone?: string,
   * }}

/**
 * A transition component inspired by the [vue transition modes](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html#Transition-Modes).
 * You can use it when you want to control the render between state transitions.
 * Based on the selected mode and the child's key which is the `Transition` or `CSSTransition` component, the `SwitchTransition` makes a consistent transition between them.
 *
 * If the `out-in` mode is selected, the `SwitchTransition` waits until the old child leaves and then inserts a new child.
 * If the `in-out` mode is selected, the `SwitchTransition` inserts a new child first, waits for the new child to enter and then removes the old child.
 *
 * **Note**: If you want the animation to happen simultaneously
 * (that is, to have the old child removed and a new child inserted **at the same time**),
 * you should use
 * [`TransitionGroup`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/transition-group)
 * instead.
 *
 * ```jsx
 * function App() {
 *  const [state, setState] = useState(false);
 *  return (
 *    <SwitchTransition>
 *      <CSSTransition
 *        key={state ? "Goodbye, world!" : "Hello, world!"}
 *        addEndListener={(node, done) => node.addEventListener("transitionend", done, false)}
 *        classNames='fade'

/**
 * The Transition component lets you describe a transition from one component
 * state to another _over time_ with a simple declarative API. Most commonly
 * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also
 * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using
 * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use
 * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)
 * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains
 * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the
 * name of the component).
 *
 * ---
 *
 * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the
 * component it renders, it only tracks "enter" and "exit" states for the
 * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For
 * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:
 *
 * ```jsx
 * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';
 *
 * const duration = 300;
 *
 * const defaultStyle = {
 *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,
 *   opacity: 0,
 * }
 *
 * const transitionStyles = {
 *   entering: { opacity: 1 },
 *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },
 *   exiting:  { opacity: 0 },
 *   exited:  { opacity: 0 },
 * };
 *
 * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (
 *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>
 *     {state => (
 *       <div style={{
 *         ...defaultStyle,
 *         ...transitionStyles[state]
 *       }}>
 *         I'm a fade Transition!
 *       </div>
 *     )}
 *   </Transition>
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:
 *  - `'entering'`
 *  - `'entered'`
 *  - `'exiting'`
 *  - `'exited'`
 *
 * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component
 * begins the "Enter" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from
 * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the
 * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete. Let's take
 * the following example (we'll use the
 * [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) hook):
 *
 * ```jsx
 * function App() {
 *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);
 *   return (
 *     <div>
 *       <Transition in={inProp} timeout={500}>
 *         {state => (
 *           // ...
 *         )}
 *       </Transition>
 *       <button onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>
 *         Click to Enter
 *       </button>
 *     </div>
 *   );
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state
 * and stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches
 * to `'entered'`.
 *
 * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from
 * `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.

/**
 * A transition component inspired by the excellent
 * [ng-animate](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAnimate) library, you should
 * use it if you're using CSS transitions or animations. It's built upon the
 * [`Transition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/transition)
 * component, so it inherits all of its props.
 *
 * `CSSTransition` applies a pair of class names during the `appear`, `enter`,
 * and `exit` states of the transition. The first class is applied and then a
 * second `*-active` class in order to activate the CSS transition. After the
 * transition, matching `*-done` class names are applied to persist the
 * transition state.
 *
 * ```jsx
 * function App() {
 *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);
 *   return (
 *     <div>
 *       <CSSTransition in={inProp} timeout={200} classNames="my-node">
 *         <div>
 *           {"I'll receive my-node-* classes"}
 *         </div>
 *       </CSSTransition>
 *       <button type="button" onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>
 *         Click to Enter
 *       </button>
 *     </div>
 *   );
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When the `in` prop is set to `true`, the child component will first receive
 * the class `example-enter`, then the `example-enter-active` will be added in
 * the next tick. `CSSTransition` [forces a
 * reflow](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/blob/5007303e729a74be66a21c3e2205e4916821524b/src/CSSTransition.js#L208-L215)
 * between before adding the `example-enter-active`. This is an important trick
 * because it allows us to transition between `example-enter` and
 * `example-enter-active` even though they were added immediately one after
 * another. Most notably, this is what makes it possible for us to animate
 * _appearance_.
 *
 * ```css
 * .my-node-enter {
 *   opacity: 0;
 * }
 * .my-node-enter-active {
 *   opacity: 1;
 *   transition: opacity 200ms;
 * }
 * .my-node-exit {
 *   opacity: 1;
 * }
 * .my-node-exit-active {
 *   opacity: 0;
 *   transition: opacity 200ms;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * `*-active` classes represent which styles you want to animate **to**, so it's
 * important to add `transition` declaration only to them, otherwise transitions
 * might not behave as intended! This might not be obvious when the transitions
 * are symmetrical, i.e. when `*-enter-active` is the same as `*-exit`, like in
 * the example above (minus `transition`), but it becomes apparent in more
 * complex transitions.
 *
 * **Note**: If you're using the
 * [`appear`](http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/transition#Transition-prop-appear)
 * prop, make sure to define styles for `.appear-*` classes as well.

   * The animation classNames applied to the component as it appears, enters,
   * exits or has finished the transition. A single name can be provided, which
   * will be suffixed for each stage, e.g. `classNames="fade"` applies:
   *
   * - `fade-appear`, `fade-appear-active`, `fade-appear-done`
   * - `fade-enter`, `fade-enter-active`, `fade-enter-done`
   * - `fade-exit`, `fade-exit-active`, `fade-exit-done`
   *
   * A few details to note about how these classes are applied:
   *
   * 1. They are _joined_ with the ones that are already defined on the child
   *    component, so if you want to add some base styles, you can use
   *    `className` without worrying that it will be overridden.
   *
   * 2. If the transition component mounts with `in={false}`, no classes are
   *    applied yet. You might be expecting `*-exit-done`, but if you think
   *    about it, a component cannot finish exiting if it hasn't entered yet.
   *
   * 2. `fade-appear-done` and `fade-enter-done` will _both_ be applied. This
   *    allows you to define different behavior for when appearing is done and
   *    when regular entering is done, using selectors like
   *    `.fade-enter-done:not(.fade-appear-done)`. For example, you could apply
   *    an epic entrance animation when element first appears in the DOM using
   *    [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/). Otherwise you can
   *    simply use `fade-enter-done` for defining both cases.
   *
   * Each individual classNames can also be specified independently like:
   *
   * ```js
   * classNames={{
   *  appear: 'my-appear',
   *  appearActive: 'my-active-appear',
   *  appearDone: 'my-done-appear',
   *  enter: 'my-enter',
   *  enterActive: 'my-active-enter',
   *  enterDone: 'my-done-enter',
   *  exit: 'my-exit',
   *  exitActive: 'my-active-exit',
   *  exitDone: 'my-done-exit',
   * }}
   * ```
   *
   * If you want to set these classes using CSS Modules:
   *
   * ```js
   * import styles from './styles.css';
   * ```
   *
   * you might want to use camelCase in your CSS file, that way could simply
   * spread them instead of listing them one by one:
   *
   * ```js
   * classNames={{ ...styles }}
   * ```
   *
   * @type {string | {
   *  appear?: string,
   *  appearActive?: string,
   *  appearDone?: string,
   *  enter?: string,
   *  enterActive?: string,
   *  enterDone?: string,
   *  exit?: string,
   *  exitActive?: string,

/**
 * A transition component inspired by the [vue transition modes](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html#Transition-Modes).
 * You can use it when you want to control the render between state transitions.
 * Based on the selected mode and the child's key which is the `Transition` or `CSSTransition` component, the `SwitchTransition` makes a consistent transition between them.
 *
 * If the `out-in` mode is selected, the `SwitchTransition` waits until the old child leaves and then inserts a new child.
 * If the `in-out` mode is selected, the `SwitchTransition` inserts a new child first, waits for the new child to enter and then removes the old child.
 *
 * **Note**: If you want the animation to happen simultaneously
 * (that is, to have the old child removed and a new child inserted **at the same time**),
 * you should use
 * [`TransitionGroup`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/transition-group)
 * instead.

/**
 * The Transition component lets you describe a transition from one component
 * state to another _over time_ with a simple declarative API. Most commonly
 * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also
 * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using
 * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use
 * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)
 * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains
 * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the
 * name of the component).
 *
 * ---
 *
 * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the
 * component it renders, it only tracks "enter" and "exit" states for the
 * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For
 * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:
 *
 * ```jsx
 * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';
 *
 * const duration = 300;
 *
 * const defaultStyle = {
 *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,
 *   opacity: 0,
 * }
 *
 * const transitionStyles = {
 *   entering: { opacity: 1 },
 *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },
 *   exiting:  { opacity: 0 },
 *   exited:  { opacity: 0 },
 * };
 *
 * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (
 *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>
 *     {state => (
 *       <div style={{
 *         ...defaultStyle,
 *         ...transitionStyles[state]
 *       }}>
 *         I'm a fade Transition!
 *       </div>
 *     )}
 *   </Transition>
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:
 *  - `'entering'`
 *  - `'entered'`
 *  - `'exiting'`
 *  - `'exited'`
 *
 * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component
 * begins the "Enter" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from
 * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the
 * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete. Let's take
 * the following example (we'll use the
 * [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) hook):
 *
 * ```jsx
 * function App() {
 *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);
 *   return (
 *     <div>
 *       <Transition in={inProp} timeout={500}>
 *         {state => (
 *           // ...
 *         )}
 *       </Transition>
 *       <button onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>
 *         Click to Enter
 *       </button>
 *     </div>
 *   );
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state
 * and stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches
 * to `'entered'`.
 *
 * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from
 * `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.

This is very challenging for audit profession in Laos since obtaining audit evidence online is brand new to the country, so gaining comfort on such procedure seems to be quite doubtful for the clients whether if they have trust in the procedure or have the ability to provide evidence using the online platform. Thus, annual field audit might be postponed if the pandemic last longer than 3-6 months. Moreover, the submission of financial statements of 2019 which is when Laos started to lockdown the whole nation is not an as simple as it used to because tax office in Laos has yet provided online platform for the financial statements\u2019 submission and This causes delays in the submission.  Decreasing in revenue is the most impacted factor in accounting profession. Some hasn\u2019t been able to collect payment from their clients due to many factors such as: limitation of the transportation, difficulty in issuing cheque due to the absence of one\u2019s manager who had to return to their home country, difficulty in expanding one\u2019s client base because even accomplishing normal tasks in timely manner has been extremely challenging and etc. These also result in many companies reducing their accountant pay check down by 50%. While the income has been decreased, the daily expense tends to stay the same or even increased as some companies need to supply surgical mask, hand sanitizer to their employees per the instruction of concern party and a huge increase in utility expense, and obligation to pay tax to the government; despite the lack of income, making a difficult situation for many individuals and entities. COVID-19 has been impacting accounting profession in Laos significantly so far.    Working from home seems to be very challenging for those who are parents because all schools; especially pre-schools, has been closed down. Distraction from ones\u2019 kids and some are not use to online working platform resulting in more time consuming to start the work and communicate with coworkers and customers.   What\u2019s more, although working online can get most of payment requisitions online, sometimes it\'s difficult to verified for accuracy without seeing original hard copy, particularly for big value payments and online working also limits the process of getting documents signed since it has not yet allowed legally and it\'s also difficult to verified for accuracy without seeing original hard copy, particularly for big value payments. Government still requires face to face contact when it comes to coordination with them because they couldn\u2019t provide the online platform to perform such tasks.",1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,,2,NA,NA,7,5,2,NA,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"Improving lT infrastructure is the first priority of Company at the moment in order to transit the traditional training and examination programs and membership management to online based program and online based system. To support new online base training, all training material need to be further developed and translated in to local language to reduce language barrier of trainees.   Technology is also the critical success factor in any organization and needs a priority to make it widely available and capability to cope with demand, all stakeholders in society depend on internets, applications, and effective way of communication and get in touch with the outside world at all levels.  Cost-cutting is a must as a survival tool in immediate effect to the long term until the economy recovers. Unnecessary spending should be under scrutiny and avoid if possible. Reviewing the working process to improve efficiency and effectiveness is important to reduce waste and tighten spending.     Support relief plans are a necessary factor for many in people and companies as the operation gets disrupted and expected return/ revenue was deeply paralyze and law enforcement of lockdown suppress society further, with some type of businesses were banned or abandoned in the cause of whole supply chain network from sourcing of materials to production, logistics and distribution retails and consumers.   International settlements become stress as a lack of foreign currencies, deteriorate exchange rate dramatically, and create a high gap of market rates vs official rate and some unavailable of a large number of foreign currencies to meet the need of companies to make payments on time causing breaching of contracts.",1,1,1,1,1,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,1,0,0,0,1,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,NA,NA,NA,3,2008,Lao People\'s Democratic Republic,LAO,East Asia and the Pacific,Finance & Prof Services\r\n19,1,15,0,Limited liability company,1,1,2,0,3,3,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,,2,NA,NA,8,5,1,20,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,,NA,0,0,0,0,,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,NA,NA,NA,1,2020,Benin,BEN,Sub-Saharan Africa,Finance & Prof Services\r\n157,21,15,0,Private Company,2,2,3,289574,1,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,,NA,0,0,0,0,,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,NA,NA,NA,NA,2000,Solomon Islands,SLB,East Asia and the Pacific,Finance & Prof Services\r\n153,4,15,2,,2,1,3,2.00E+05,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,We are an event driven organisation...with covid 19 we have to cancel all our activities such as pitch night.
